# Workshop: Get started to deploy a Java Microservices application to `Code Engine`

### Objectives

The workshop addresses the topic containerized applications on `IBM Cloud Code Engine`.

After you complete this workshop, you'll have a basic understanding of the following:

  * Deploy an existing Java microservices `containerized` application example to `Code Engine`
      * See the usage of the `IBM Cloud Code Engine CLI`
  * Understand internal and external `HTTP/HTTPS routing` between the microservices
  * Use the `Out-Of-The-Box` monitoring for the example application
  * Use the `Out-Of-The-Box` logging for the example application

> _The scope of this workshop is not to explain every aspect of running an application or job on `Code Engine`. It's just about containerized applications._

### Prerequisites

* In order to run this workshop, you will need to create an [IBM Cloud `PayAsYouGo` account](https://ibm.biz/BdfXAn) (or log in to your existing account).

  > `Code Engine` has a `free tier` per month, and we expect, if you haven't used that `free tier` in current month, you can execute the workshop without creating any additional costs. For the monitoring and logging we will use free lite plans for the service instances [IBM Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-getting-started#getting-started) and 
 [IBM Cloud Log Analysis](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-getting-started#getting-started).

* You should have a basic understanding of containerized applications

### Architecture

> This `workshop` is related to the [Cloud Native Starter](https://github.com/ibm/cloud-native-starter) project. In the workshop we use a costomized version of the [security application example](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/tutorials/secure-your-java-microservices-application-workshop/). 

The example application simply shows articles protected with an `Identity and Access Manegement`.
In the following picture you see the frontend with the articles and the valid user `alice` is logged on.

![](images/cns-ce-example-application-00.png)

The following diagram shows the architecture of the example application. There is a `web-app` frontend application that serves the Javascript/Vue.js code to the browser. The `web-app` code running in the browser invokes a REST API of the `web-api` microservice. The `web-api` microservice in turn invokes a REST API of the `articles` microservice. [`Keycloak`](https://www.keycloak.org/) is used for the `Identity and Access Manegement` of that microservices based application. To see the results in the web application, users need to be authenticated and they need to have the role `user`.

The image below shows the dependencies of the example:

* External and internal routing

In our context it's useful to have a basic understanding of the routing for example application. Based on the functionality of the application, we need `three external routes` for the example application.

Each external route communication will be automaticly secured with a [TLS Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) created by `Code Engine` using [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). The three applications are the `web-app` which will be loaded into the browser, the `Keycloak` that must be available for the authentication/authorization to our application and for potential configruation the `Identity and Access Manegement` and finally the `web-api` microservice which provides the articles data and will be invoked be the `web-app`.

The `articles` microservice doesn't need to be invoked from external, so it's configured to provide only an `internal route`, which is used by the  `web-api` microservice to get the articles from.

* Basics about the deployment

For an easy deployment prebuild containers were created and pushed to a [Quay container registry](https://quay.io/user/tsuedbroecker).
In the following table you see the **application**/container, the exposed **routes**, uses of **TLS Encryption**, the **scale to zero** configuration, the **container registry** where the prebuild container comes from, the configuration for **vCPU** and **Memory in GB** and the **min/max Instances** for the applications.

| **Application** | **Route** | **TLS Encryption** | **Scale to zero** | **Container Registry** | **vCPU** | **Memory** | **min Instances** | **max Instances** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  --- | --- |  --- | --- | --- |
| web-app | external | yes |yes | Quey | 0.5 | 1 GB | 0 | 1 |
| **keycloak** | external | yes | **no** | Docker | 0.5 | 1 GB | 1 | 1 |
| web-api  | external | yes | yes | Quey | 0.5 | 1 GB | 0 | 1 |
| **articles** | **internal** | no (mTLS comming sone) | yes | Quey | 0.25 | 0.5G GB | 0 | 1 |

The `Keycloak` application for the `Identity and Access Manegement` isn't configured to `scale to zero`, because the application is `stateful` and contains the realm configuration, which will be delete, if you would restart the application.

_Note:_ The project also contains the source code, that you can use to customize to your an own version of the microservices based example application.
